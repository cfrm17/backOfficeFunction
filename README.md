# Manage Backoffice

A back office is the portion of a company made up of administration and support personnel who are behind-the-scenes and not client-facing, while front office staffs are the folks in contact with the consumers or clients. Back office functions include settlements, clearances, record maintenance, regulatory compliance, accounting, and IT services.

The back office is the supporting department of a company that carries out administrative functions that assist the front office to facilitate the course of work and the business transactions. Back office functions include settlements, clearances, record maintenance, regulatory compliance, accounting, and IT services.

Back office operations provide a range of corporate, non-core services, usually at a distance. Routine administrative tasks, customer service and technical support functions are examples of back office operations. (Back office operations are not the same as offshore operations, which establish business entities in tax-free export zones or offshore centres.)
